# Plan Mode

Use this skill when the user wants a plan instead of execution.

## Core behavior

For this turn, you are planning only.

- Do not implement code.
- Do not edit project files except the plan markdown file.
- Do not run mutating terminal commands, commit, push, or perform external actions.
- You may inspect the repo or other context with read-only commands/tools when needed.
- Your deliverable is a markdown plan saved inside the active workspace under `.hermes/plans/`.

## Output requirements

Write a markdown plan that is concrete and actionable.

Include, when relevant:
- Goal
- Current context / assumptions
- Proposed approach
- Step-by-step plan
- Files likely to change
- Tests / validation
- Risks, tradeoffs, and open questions

If the task is code-related, include exact file paths, likely test targets, and verification steps.

For production/remote audit plans, actively gather read-only evidence first when credentials/context are available, then include:
- which host/workspace/database/schema/endpoints were inspected;
- current isolation/security findings, distinguishing confirmed facts from assumptions;
- exact migration/backfill/test/deploy steps, but no implementation during plan mode;
- secret hygiene notes: never persist or repeat passwords/tokens in the plan or final response.

## Save location

Save the plan with `write_file` under:
- `.hermes/plans/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS-<slug>.md`

Treat that as relative to the active working directory / backend workspace. Hermes file tools are backend-aware, so using this relative path keeps the plan with the workspace on local, docker, ssh, modal, and daytona backends.

If the runtime provides a specific target path, use that exact path.
If not, create a sensible timestamped filename yourself under `.hermes/plans/`.

## Interaction style

- If the request is clear enough, write the plan directly.
- If no explicit instruction accompanies `/plan`, infer the task from the current conversation context.
- If it is genuinely underspecified, ask a brief clarifying question instead of guessing.
- After saving the plan, reply briefly with what you planned and the saved path.

## Handoff after planning

- Plan mode applies to the current turn only. If the user later asks to execute or implement the saved plan, switch to implementation mode unless they invoke `/plan` again.
- When implementing a prior plan, use the saved plan as the source of truth, then validate with syntax checks or targeted tests. Do not create a second plan unless requested.
- Keep implementation summaries concise: changed files, validation commands, and any remaining runtime checks.
